# mtg-table — plan

Source of truth: [`docs/research/05-architecture-synthesis.md`](docs/research/05-architecture-synthesis.md)
§9. That document is the spec; this file is its schedule, kept up to date as
milestones land.

Eight milestones, each with **one runnable command and a deliverable you can look
at**. Total estimate ~13 evenings, first browser game at evening 7.

| | Milestone | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | The engine runs our code | 1 evening | **done** |
| M1 | Record a game and scrub through it in the browser | 2 evenings | **done** — hardened, all six follow-ups closed |
| M2 | A full game against the AI, in the terminal | 2 evenings | **done** — two review passes closed; eight follow-ups open, none blocking |
| M3 | The same game, in a browser tab | 2 evenings | not started |
| M4 | A board that looks like Magic | 3 evenings | not started |
| M5 | Nothing dead-ends | 3 evenings | not started |
| M6 | Comfort | 2 evenings | not started |
| M7 | Arena mode: the game as a cinematic | open-ended (Tier 1: weeks) | not started |

---

## M0 — The engine runs our code

**Status: done** (evidence: [`docs/evidence/m0-smoke.md`](docs/evidence/m0-smoke.md)).
**Effort: 1 evening.**

**Command**

```bash
./tools/check-forge.sh && ./bridge/build.sh && ./bridge/run.sh mtgtable.Smoke
```

**Deliverable.** The first commit. In under 10 seconds the run prints the
`FModel.initialize` timing (measured ~2,033 ms), `cards in DB = 95126`,
`deck = … (40 cards)` and an AI-vs-AI match result — with `~/.forge` and `~/forge`
provably untouched (`sha1sum` the trees before and after, specifically
`~/.forge/decks/constructed/`).

Files: `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `README.md` with its NON-GOALS list, `.gitignore`,
`PLAN.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/protocol.md`, `config.json`,
`tools/check-forge.sh`, `tools/make-forge-home.sh`, `forge-home/`,
`bridge/build.sh`, `bridge/run.sh`, `bridge/src/mtgtable/HeadlessGuiBase.java`,
`bridge/src/mtgtable/Smoke.java`.

**Watch for.** `GuiBase.setInterface(...)` must be the first Forge call in the
process. `isGuiThread()` must be the named-thread check. Record whether
`Match.prepareAllZones` emits any `revealUnsupported` complaint for an MSH/MSC
card.

**Resolved 2026-09-11.** The `SVar 'Any' not found in ability, fallback to Card
(Quantum Reduction)` warning — which also fires for Helicarrier Strike, the
deck's other `K:Teamwork:2` card — is **benign and informational, not a finding**.
The string `"Any"` is a hard-coded sentinel inside `CostTeamwork`, not in any card
file, so no override can remove it; the computed amount is 0 either way and all
three rules paths skip it. `Smoke` / `RecordMatch` classify it as `svar-fallback`
at **informational** level and a non-zero count is not a failure
(`docs/research/08-deck-card-coverage.md` §3).

Also resolved here: the bootstrap now sets `FPref.UI_SELECT_FROM_CARD_DISPLAYS`
to `"false"` (**D13**) and `make-forge-home.sh` installs the corrected
A.I.M. Scientists card script (**D14**), which `Smoke` verifies by printing the
loaded card's keywords.

## M1 — Record a game and scrub through it in the browser

**Status: done** — the hardening pass landed and all six of its follow-ups are
closed (evidence: [`docs/evidence/m1-record.md`](docs/evidence/m1-record.md),
[`m1-web.md`](docs/evidence/m1-web.md),
[`m1-hardening.md`](docs/evidence/m1-hardening.md),
[`m1-followups.md`](docs/evidence/m1-followups.md)).
**Effort: 2 evenings.**

**Command**

```bash
./bridge/run.sh mtgtable.RecordMatch --deck decks/pacho-shield.dck --seed 42 \
    --out fixtures/games/g1.jsonl
npm --prefix web run dev:replay            # opens /?replay=games/g1.jsonl
./tools/check-all.sh                       # the gate: lint, build, smoke, re-record, redaction, web tests
```

**Deliverable.** Two AI seats play to completion and write the frame log; the
browser then shows a text board — turn/round, phase, both life totals, each zone
as a list, hands as backs, library counts, the stack, combat bands — with
prev / next / play / speed.

This is the keystone. It builds `Json`, `Snap`, redaction, `GameLog`,
`protocol.ts`, `reduce.ts`, the `Transport` interface and the entire board
renderer **with no socket, no blocking input and no possible deadlock**, and it
leaves committed fixtures so every later front-end evening runs without a JVM.

Also ships here: a redaction test that feeds `g1.jsonl` to a checker asserting no
opponent hand card ever carries a `name`.

**Added 2026-09-11.** Every `state` frame also carries `events`
(`docs/protocol.md` §3.6): the engine events the snapshot reflects, as id-only
objects. The text board lists them; they exist for M7. The redaction checker also
asserts no `name` key appears under `events`.

**Hardening pass, 2026-09-11 (what M1 shipped without, and then got).** Two audits
landed after M1 was first recorded — `docs/research/06-hidden-information-audit.md`
and `07-wireguigame-spec.md`, plus `08`, `10` and `11` — and the M1 review found a
second, ungated string path to the wire. The protocol amendments are applied
(`docs/protocol.md` → "Amendments"); the M1 work items are:

- the five-key redacted stub (`owner` added), `library: {count, cards}`, `Card.alt`
  and `Card.token` in `Snap.java`, `protocol.ts` and the checker;
- `tools/lint-bridge.sh` (the banned-accessor grep, wired into `bridge/build.sh`)
  and `tools/check-all.sh` (the one command to run before committing);
- `tools/check-redaction.mjs` grows report 06 §9's assertions A1–A11, including
  **name-before-reveal** — a full opponent-owned card in a hidden zone is a
  failure unless that id was revealed earlier through a public zone, an `ask`
  body, `input.focusCard` or `library.cards`;
- fixtures `g1`/`g2`/`g3` re-recorded at seeds 42 / 7 / 2026 after the `Snap`
  change, with the web tests green on the regenerated files.

**Second round, same day (the hardening review).** Four more items, all of them
"the test does not test what it says":

- `check-redaction.mjs` was silently downgrading the **absence** of every field
  this pass added to a warning, so five reverted amendments passed the gate. The
  tolerance is now behind `--pre-amendment`, which nothing uses, and the checker
  has a negative-control corpus of its own — `fixtures/negative/redaction/`, one
  defect per file, asserted by `tools/check-redaction-selftest.mjs` as step 7 of
  `check-all.sh`.
- `fixtures/synthetic/sample-handwritten.jsonl` was still pre-amendment *and* was
  the only artifact carrying `input` / `ask` / `answer` frames, so P6 and P7 had
  no coverage at all. Regenerated with all **eleven** ask kinds, their answers,
  and the `input` fields P7 added — and `check-all.sh` now runs the checker over
  `fixtures/synthetic/` too.
- `library.cards` was `[]` in every recording, because neither deck runs a
  continuous `MayLookAt` static. `decks/future-sight-probe.dck` and
  `fixtures/games/future-sight.jsonl` are the engine evidence for P2, and the web
  suite now asserts the corpus still contains content rather than only a shape.
- the `faceDownHidden` shape retired by P3 was still specified as live in
  `docs/protocol.md` §3.3, §8.5 and §9, in `CLAUDE.md` rule 8 and in report 05's
  amendment note, while no emitter had produced one for hours.

What remains engine-unevidenced (`surveil` / `phased` / `foretold`, a face-down
card outside play, and every `ask`/`input` shape) is named as M2-E1…M2-E6 in
`docs/evidence/m1-hardening.md` §2.2 — an AI-vs-AI recording has no seat to
produce them, so they belong to M2, not to M1.

M1 is **not** reopened by any of this: the deliverable (record → scrub in the
browser) works. The hardening is what makes the redaction claim testable rather than
coincidental, and it is cheaper now than after M3 freezes the reducer.

### M1 follow-ups — all six closed, 2026-09-11

Raised by the hardening verifier, done during M2, each verified by mutation.
Evidence: [`docs/evidence/m1-followups.md`](docs/evidence/m1-followups.md) (the
per-item measurements and diffs) plus
[`m2-console.md`](docs/evidence/m2-console.md) §5 and the review pass below.
**Nothing on this list is outstanding**; what M1 left genuinely open is the
engine evidence for the ask kinds, which is on the M2 follow-ups list.

- **closed** — `tools/check-redaction.mjs`: an opponent's library dumped as full
  cards now **fails** by default, with `--opponent-library-ok` as the explicit
  escape. Proved by mutating a fixture: exit 1 without the flag, exit 0 with it.
- **closed** — `tools/check-redaction.mjs` asserts per-kind `answer` shapes
  (`ANSWER_RULES`), including the two kinds with no null default. It now also
  asserts per-kind **`ask`** shapes and their declared nullability.
- **closed** — `tools/check-all.sh` step 6: the fresh re-record is normalised
  (`t`, `startedAt`, `gameId`) and diffed against `fixtures/games/g1.jsonl`.
- **closed** — the redacted stub's `zone` is non-null: `Snap.card()` falls back
  to the caller's hint and then to `"unknown"`.
- **closed** — `web/test/render.test.tsx` mounts `<Board/>` over every fixture
  under vitest, and `npm test` runs it after the node suite.
- **closed** — `fixtures/synthetic/sample-handwritten.jsonl` is regenerated from
  `tools/make-sample-fixture.mjs` with all eleven ask kinds, the five-key stub,
  `token` / `alt` / `library.cards`, and a session header carrying `transport`.

### M2 review pass, 2026-09-11 (what the reviewer found, and what closed it)

Ten findings against the first M2 build. Three majors and seven minors; the wire
changes are `docs/protocol.md`'s **M1–M7** amendment rows.

- **`notice` was an ungated string path.** `message(message, title)` wrote both
  arguments verbatim and `PlayerControllerHuman.notifyOfValue` passes
  `CardView.get(sa.getHostCard()).toString()` as the title, so five recordings
  carried `{"title":"Thriving Isle (49)"}` while card 49 was a hidden stub in the
  opponent's hand. `Snap.sweepText` now gates both strings, `WireGuiGame` caches
  the frame's concealed-id set on the game thread, and `check-redaction.mjs`
  **fails** on a hit (protocol §6).
- **`over` was emitted only from `finishGame`/`afterGameEnd`**, which Forge does
  not reliably call after a concede: two of four identical console runs wrote no
  `over` at all and still exited 0. The outcome capture is now the emitter, and
  the console quit path exits **2** when there is still no `over` (protocol §7).
- **Nine of the eleven ask kinds had never been dispatched by Forge.** The answer
  marshalling moved to `mtgtable.Ask` (no Forge types) and
  `mtgtable.AskSelfTest` drives every kind from real JSON in `bridge/build.sh`;
  two probe decks reach two of the nine for real —
  `decks/trample-probe.dck` → `assign_damage`, `decks/scry-probe.dck` →
  `input.focusCard` — and are committed as fixtures.
- Plus: gate 0 now covers a null `ZoneType` on the M2 card entry points;
  `NullTransport` delivers its null through `onAnswer` so its log has answers
  rather than looking like a wedge; `Transport.Inbound`'s thread contract says
  what the asserts actually enforce; three ask fields agree at both ends; and the
  run summary prints the game-thread / EDT split of every focus push.

### M2 verification pass, 2026-09-11 (an independent replay of the evidence)

A verifier rebuilt from scratch, ran six games and re-derived every number.
Nothing under `~/.forge` or `~/forge` changed; the gate passed; the redaction
audit found no leak. Seven findings, two of which were real defects and five of
which were the docs and the gate lagging the code. All closed:

- **major — `GameLog.close()` self-deadlocked against its own appender thread.**
  `close()` was `synchronized` and held the monitor across `thread.join(30s)`,
  while `drain()` needed that same monitor after every written line, so a line in
  flight meant the join **always** timed out and the file was truncated at
  whatever the appender had flushed (measured: `n=1 → close() = 30,000 ms`;
  `n=20000 → 12,089 of 20,001 lines`). It fired in 2 of the verifier's 6 real
  games — `total wall` exceeding `game wall` by exactly 30 s — and every
  `frames = N log line(s)` printed after it was wrong. The counter is an
  `AtomicLong`, the appender takes no lock, the join is outside the monitor, and
  a join that still times out **throws**. `mtgtable.GameLogSelfTest` (new, in
  `bridge/build.sh`) asserts close in under a second and exactly `N+1` lines;
  re-introducing either half of the defect makes it exit 1.
- **major — the protocol's clickability rule was falsified by M2's own
  recordings.** Closed as amendment **M8**; see `docs/protocol.md` §4/§4.1/§4.2,
  report 10 §0.0 item 6 and §18.3, `web/src/render/Board.tsx`, and the test in
  `web/test/human-seat.test.ts` that pins it to the corpus (328 of 345
  `clickCard` acts fall outside `input.selectable.cardIds`).
- **minor — `onResync()` disarmed the pre-input act guard** (the fix, and the
  test M3 owes it, are under M3 below).
- **minor — the "no thread of ours is named `Game*`" assert covered 2 of 7
  names.** All seven are constants now, `HeadlessGuiBase`'s static block checks
  the whole set against the stronger `mtg-table-` prefix, and
  `tools/lint-bridge.sh` **rule 6** greps every `new Thread(` under `bridge/src`
  for a name that resolves to one — which catches a thread that no run
  constructs.
- **minor — the gate never ran the console or auto transports.**
  `tools/check-all.sh` has two new steps: the documented console smoke (exit 0,
  exactly one `over`, `over` last) and one `--transport auto --seed 11` game (a
  seed no fixture uses; zero UNIMPL, zero emit errors). Both logs go through
  `check-redaction.mjs`, which now downgrades its two "this file proves nothing"
  assertions to **warnings** when every `state` in the file is `turn: 0` — the
  documented console command concedes before a card is dealt, so the repo's own
  gate used to reject the artifact the repo's own docs told you to make.
- **minor — two emitter defects.** A frame emitted before `openView` went on the
  wire with `seq: 0` (amendment **M9**): `GameLog` numbers and holds it until the
  session header instead. And `assignGenericAmount`'s fallback arm wrote
  `String.valueOf(t)` as an option label — unreachable today, but the exact shape
  of the leak amendment M1 closed — so it writes the class name, like its sibling
  in `assignCombatDamage`.
- **minor (no code) — the size of the unevidenced surface, stated where a reader
  will see it.** `docs/evidence/m2-console.md` §8 now says: across eleven
  recordings the engine has dispatched **three** of the eleven ask kinds.

## M2 — A full game against the AI, in the terminal

**Status: done**, with eight follow-ups open below and none of them blocking M3
(evidence: [`docs/evidence/m2-console.md`](docs/evidence/m2-console.md) — §11 is
the current status — plus the review pass and the independent verification pass
above).
**Effort: 2 evenings.**

**Command**

```bash
./bridge/run.sh mtgtable.MtgTable --transport console --seed 42
```

Type `?` at the prompt for the command list; `README.md`'s *Playing the console
game* is the same table in prose. The other two transports are the same seat
without a human in it — `--transport auto` plays a minimal legal game by itself
(D16) and `--transport null` answers every ask with `null` so the game runs on
Forge's own documented defaults. All three are in `tools/check-all.sh`.

**Deliverable.** The user beats (or loses to) the Forge AI with their own deck,
without a browser.

**What the evidence actually shows** (`docs/evidence/m2-console.md`, plus the two
passes below):

- **Games finish.** Four complete games to a terminal `over` in the first pass
  and more since, with **zero `UNIMPL`**, zero emit errors and zero dropped
  events. **22 of the 37** members have fired in a real game; the other 15 are
  implemented and never reached by a W/U deck at `setGamesPerMatch(1)`.
- **Redaction survives a human seat**, which is the first time it was tested at
  all: across the five committed human-seat fixtures there are **3,164 opponent
  hand cards** (1,638 in the three `human-auto-*` alone) and **every single one
  is the five-key stub** — `{controller, hidden, id, owner, zone}`, no other key
  set occurs. `check-redaction.mjs` passes all five. The review pass then closed
  the one string path that was not gated (`notice`).
- **Five committed fixtures now carry the frames an AI-vs-AI recording cannot
  produce** — `input`, `ask`, `answer`, `notice`, `over`, and a `transport` key
  in the session header: `human-auto-{42,7,2026}.jsonl` plus the two probe-deck
  recordings `human-trample-7.jsonl` (the `assign_damage` ask) and
  `human-scry-7.jsonl` (`input.focusCard`).
- **The gate runs the seat.** `tools/check-all.sh` is twelve steps and green,
  three of them fresh human-seat games (null, the scripted console smoke, and
  `auto` at a seed no fixture uses), each asserted to end in exactly one `over`
  as its last frame, each log put through `check-redaction.mjs`. Every JVM step
  is under a `timeout`.
- **`docs/protocol.md` needed no new shape for M2** — every body emitted already
  conformed to §2.2/§3/§4/§5. The nine amendments **M1–M9** it did gain are
  corrections the two review passes forced, not M2 discovering the spec was
  short.

Five decisions the build made are now written down: **D15** (the ask timeout is
a transport policy: infinite for the console, 30 s for `auto`/`null`), **D16**
(`AutoTransport` is the automated human and `NullTransport` overrides only its
answer half), **D17** (acts hop to the virtual EDT, answers arrive on
`mtg-table-io`, both asserted), **D18** (`isLibgdxPort()` stays `false`, so the
input path is the primary path) and **D19** (phase stops live in `WireGuiGame`'s
own map, seeded from the prefs and never saved).

`WireGuiGame` with all **37** abstract members present behind `Transport`, plus
`ReplyPool` and `ConsoleTransport`. This de-risks the whole threading model —
virtual EDT, latch-blocking vs value-returning calls, answering from a third
thread — with no WebSocket and no DOM. Every unimplemented member logs
`UNIMPL <name>` and returns a safe default rather than throwing, so a game
degrades instead of dead-ending and the log says which of the 37 actually fire for
a W/U deck.

### M2 follow-ups — open, 2026-09-11

M2 is **done**, not perfect. Everything below is carried from the builders' and
the verifiers' own "problems" notes; none of it blocks M3, and each line says who
should pick it up. Nothing here is a known leak — the redaction gate is closed
and tested — they are gaps in *evidence* and two small decisions left standing.

1. **A decision nobody has made: the last `state` before `over`.** Amendment
   **M4** says `over` is emitted "after the `state` that carries it", but today
   the emitter reaches `over` through `captureOutcome()` rather than through a
   final `flushState`, so `over` can arrive with no `gameOver` snapshot in front
   of it. The committed `fixtures/games/human-auto-42.jsonl` has 1,611 lines /
   227 `state` frames; today's build produces 1,610 / 226, and the missing one is
   exactly that final snapshot. It was proved to **predate** the verification
   pass (the same seed on a build with that pass's three `WireGuiGame` edits
   reverted produces the same 1,610). Either emit the final `state`
   unconditionally or soften M4's wording — and then re-record. See
   `docs/evidence/m2-console.md` §10.4.
2. **Seven of the eleven ask kinds still have no engine evidence.** The
   committed corpus contains **three** — `choose_list`, `order` and
   `assign_damage` (the last only because `decks/trample-probe.dck` was built to
   force it) — and a fourth, `choose_entities`, fired in an uncommitted console
   session (`m2-console.md` §3.2). `confirm`, `options`, `text`, `assign_amount`,
   `manipulate_list`, `sideboard` and a real multi-option `ability_menu` are
   implemented against report 07 §7, unit-tested by `mtgtable.AskSelfTest`, and
   shape-pinned by `ASK_SHAPES` plus the hand-written fixture — **none of which
   can prove the emitter**. Two of them are reveal surfaces and are already
   scheduled as M5's first move (the probe decks).
3. **Gate 0's `"unknown"` arm has never been observed at runtime.** `unzoned
   cards = 0` in every game run so far, so the null-`ZoneType` branch of
   `Snap`'s concealment gate is reasoned and reviewed, not measured. Reaching it
   needs an LKI view / `getCardForUi` / a `chooseCardsPile` header, and no
   committed deck produces one.
4. **Amendment M9's pre-header path is self-test-only.** `GameLogSelfTest`
   covers it deterministically, but no real run has emitted a frame before
   `openView`: `printf "q\n" | … --transport console` still delivers the concede
   after the seat exists. The bounded buffer and the empty-file-plus-stderr
   behaviour have no engine evidence.
5. **The `transport` session-header key is optional, deliberately.** `RecordMatch`
   does not write it, so an absent key means "an engine recording with no seat"
   and the six AI-vs-AI fixtures did not have to be regenerated. The cost is that
   the checker's A12 rule is conditional: a `null` answer to `order` or
   `choose_list` is a **warning** when the header says `transport: "null"` and a
   failure otherwise. Making the key mandatory means regenerating every fixture;
   that is the decision, and it is cheapest to take before M3 adds `"ws"`.
6. **`docs/research/07-wireguigame-spec.md` §10 step 3 is wrong and has not been
   corrected.** It prescribes a null transport that answers only asks and
   expects a finished game; measured, that parks at the coin toss after five
   frames, because with `isLibgdxPort() == false` the seat is driven by the input
   path (D18). `NullTransport` therefore extends `AutoTransport`. Whoever next
   owns report 07 should fix that step so the next reader does not rebuild the
   same dead end.
7. **`emitOver`'s wait loop was kept, not deleted.** The verification pass
   considered removing it and did not; it is redundant with the outcome capture
   in the common path but still the thing that makes `finishGame` idempotent
   under a concede. Left as-is, named here so it is a decision rather than an
   oversight.
8. **Two transport tests belong to M3, not here** — the `connect → resync →
   concede` case and a scripted `--transport ws` step in `check-all.sh`. Both
   are on M3's doorstep below.

**Five findings from `docs/research/07-wireguigame-spec.md` that change how this
evening is spent.** Read that document before writing a line; it is the M2
implementation spec.

1. **There is a 37th abstract member.** `AbstractGuiGame` declares
   `protected abstract void updateCurrentPlayer(PlayerView)` — it is not on
   `IGuiGame`, so the name-level diff that produced "36" missed it, and **the
   class will not compile without it**. Note the `protected`.
2. **Build the `input` path first; the `ask` path is secondary.** With
   `isLibgdxPort() == false`, almost every yes/no goes through `InputConfirm`
   (prompt + buttons) rather than `IGuiGame.confirm` — every direct
   `getGui().confirm(...)` call site is guarded by `if (getGui().isLibgdxPort())`.
   A console client that implements only the blocking calls will sit at a prompt
   it never receives. This is the single biggest scheduling fact in the spec.
3. **`handleGameEvents` can fire off the game thread.** Our forwarder is an
   `InputQueue` observer, and `InputQueue.updateObservers()` is reached from
   `removeInput`/`clearInputs` via `InputSyncronizedBase.stop()`, which runs on
   whatever thread delivered the click. Walking `CardView` there corrupts the
   `Tracker` silently. So: **guard on `ThreadUtil.isGameThread()` and buffer the
   batch when it is false**; the next game-thread flush ships it. Log the deferred
   count — a non-zero value confirms the finding and is expected, not a bug.
4. **`openZones` / `tempShowZones` are not questions**, and they arrive on the
   **EDT**, where blocking stalls every prompt. Answer them locally, echo the
   argument, and push `input.openZones` (`docs/protocol.md` §4.3). The
   `open_zones` ask kind is gone; eleven kinds remain.
5. **Three rules, written down before anything else** (spec §2.5): a push method
   may touch only `getId()` on a view; only the game thread may block (every
   value-returning override opens with
   `if (!ThreadUtil.isGameThread()) return <local default>;`); and **no thread we
   create may be named `Game*`**, because `ThreadUtil.isGameThread()` is a bare
   `getName().startsWith("Game")`.

Two shapes that will otherwise be written wrong: `OrderResult` is
`(List<T> ordered, boolean rememberDecision)` and `order` must **never** return
`null`; and ask options are addressed by **ask-local index**, because Forge's `T`
is frequently a colour, an integer or a cost rather than a view object
(`docs/protocol.md` §5.1).

## M3 — The same game, in a browser tab

**Status: not started.**
**Effort: 2 evenings.**

**Command**

```bash
./scripts/play.sh
```

**Deliverable.** Play the S.H.I.E.L.D. deck against the AI to a win or a loss in
Chrome, clicking card names in lists and text buttons. Ugly, complete, and the
protocol is now proven against every question the engine actually asks. **This is
the "it works" moment**; everything after is polish.

`WsTransport` (netty `HttpServerCodec` → `HttpObjectAggregator(1MB)` →
`ChunkedWriteHandler` → `WebSocketServerProtocolHandler("/ws")`), `hello_ok`,
reconnect via `resync`, `cancelAll()` on disconnect, per-ask timeout. `web/` swaps
`ReplayTransport` for `WsTransport` — **the board component is unchanged**. Every
session is logged and replayable.

**Three things the M2 verification pass leaves on M3's doorstep.**

1. **A transport test for connect → `resync` → `concede`,** asserting no
   exception and an `over` frame. `resync` is a first-class client frame
   (`docs/protocol.md` §2.4) and a browser that autoconnects will send one before
   Forge has asked this seat for anything; `WireGuiGame.onResync` used to arm
   `inputSeen` and disarm the guard that keeps a concede out of
   `Match.prepareAllZones`, where removing a player mid-iteration throws inside
   Forge's own setup. The guard is fixed (`engineInput` vs `mutateInput`); the
   test is what keeps it fixed.
2. **The board sends a click for any card, not only a selectable one**
   (amendment **M8**). `selectable` is the *explicit* selection set and is empty
   for the whole of your main phase — 78 of 86 `clickCard` acts in
   `human-auto-42.jsonl` name an id outside it. Forge judges the click; a
   rejected one comes back as `notice{title:"Not selectable"}`.
3. **`--transport ws` belongs in `tools/check-all.sh`** the way `null`,
   `console` and `auto` now are: a scripted session under the same
   `GAME_TIMEOUT`, exactly one `over`, `over` last, and its log through
   `check-redaction.mjs`.

**Three more that M2 hands over with the socket.**

4. **`WsTransport` owes an `askTimeoutMs` of its own** (**D15**). The console
   answers `0` — wait forever, because a human is thinking — and `auto`/`null`
   answer 30 s so a test fails fast. A socket is neither: the right cap is tied
   to the connection's liveness, not to a clock, and `cancelAll()` on disconnect
   is what unblocks the parked game threads. Deciding this by copying either
   existing value is the bug.
5. **It writes `transport: "ws"` into the session header** (amendment **M3**,
   §8.1), which is also the moment to settle M2 follow-up 5 — whether the key
   becomes mandatory and every fixture is regenerated.
6. **`Transport.Inbound`'s contract is the comment M3 is written against.** Not
   "called on `mtg-table-io`" but "never a game thread and never the EDT",
   asserted at the top of `onAct` and `onAnswer` (**D17**). Netty's event-loop
   thread satisfies it; a handler that hops to its own executor must still
   satisfy it.

**Gate before this ships — now closed.** The `DelayedReveal` / `tempShowZones` /
`openZones` enumeration is
[`docs/research/06-hidden-information-audit.md`](docs/research/06-hidden-information-audit.md)
§2: twelve reveal paths, each with its wire channel and its leak signature, plus
the exhaustive grep of the three `mayLook` sets that is the complete
dynamic-reveal surface. What is left is *implementation*, and it must be in place
before a human seat exists:

- every card inside an `ask` or `input` body goes through the one serialising
  function, and **every option label** through the same gate (`"???"` when
  concealed) — the label, not the card object, is the leak that will actually
  happen;
- `input.focusCard` carries the serialised card, because `setCard` is pushed with
  cards that are not in the snapshot;
- the redaction checker runs on a recorded M3 session, not only on the M1
  fixtures;
- `docs/protocol.md` §10's planned M6 fields are already specified — add them
  while the reducer is still soft, or pay for it in M6.

`input.prompt` can still name a card the viewer may not see (Forge builds those
strings, we do not): the checker **warns** on it, and it is accepted residual
risk, documented in report 06 §10 (residual risk 3).

## M4 — A board that looks like Magic

**Status: not started.**
**Effort: 3 evenings.**

**Command**

```bash
node tools/fetch-art.ts && ./scripts/play.sh
```

**Deliverable.** A screenshot the user would show someone. Real layout: opponent
permanents row, middle table, own permanents, hand at the bottom, left rail (life,
zone counts, decision panel), right rail (phase strip). Real card images, tap =
90° rotate, summoning-sick tint, `input.selectable` outlines on clickable cards.
A missing image renders a generated text card frame and never blocks a click.

Spec: [`docs/research/10-board-ui-spec.md`](docs/research/10-board-ui-spec.md)
(component tree, layout tokens, wireframes at 1600×900 and 1280×720, the arrow
geometry, the three evenings). Write the components against the **post-hardening**
wire from the start rather than retrofitting: **one** concealed shape (the
five-key stub) plus a face-down card that is an ordinary `Card` with `name: ""`
and `alt: null` — report 10 §0.0's "three card shapes, not two" was superseded by
amendment P3 the same day — `Card.token`, `Card.alt`, `library.cards`,
`input.focusCard`, and a `card` on every ask option (`docs/protocol.md`
§3.2–§3.4, §4, §5.1).

## M5 — Nothing dead-ends

**Status: not started.**
**Effort: 3 evenings.**

**Command**

```bash
./scripts/play.sh   # ten consecutive games
grep UNIMPL var/*.log
```

**Deliverable / exit criterion.** Ten consecutive games with **zero `UNIMPL`
lines** and no state where the board is stuck waiting on something the browser
cannot express.

Every `ask` kind gets real UI: mana payment (tap lands plus the engine's own Auto
button, which runs `ComputerUtilMana.payManaCost` inside `InputPayMana`),
targeting from `selectable` min/max, attacker and blocker declaration,
`assign_damage`, and modals for `choose_list` / `choose_entities` / `order` /
`assign_amount`; click-to-open graveyard and exile browsers; SVG targeting arrows
from `stack[].targetCardIds` and `combat.bands`.

**Start with two probe decks, before any UI.** The committed corpus contains
**three** of the eleven ask kinds — `choose_list`, `order` and `assign_damage`,
the last only because `decks/trample-probe.dck` was built to force it — plus
`choose_entities` in an uncommitted console session
(`docs/evidence/m2-console.md` §3.2, §8, §11). The two worth forcing next are the
largest *reveal* surfaces, where being wrong is a leak and not a dead end: a deck
that forces `choose_entities` **with a `delayedReveal`** (a library search) and
one that forces `manipulate_list`. Same move as `trample-probe` and `scry-probe`:
a deck, a recording committed as a fixture, and the checker run over it. Until
then those two kinds are evidenced by `AskSelfTest` and a fixture we wrote
ourselves, which cannot prove the *emitter* is right.

## M6 — Comfort

**Status: not started.**
**Effort: 2 evenings.**

**Command**

```bash
./scripts/play.sh   # three games back to back, one command typed
```

**Deliverable.** New Game without restarting the JVM (`HostedMatch.restartMatch`),
Undo, Concede, phase stops, Pass-To, always-yes/no, keyboard shortcuts mirroring
Forge's own `SHORTCUT_*` keycodes, mana-font pips, error toasts.

**Every one of these is an engine feature rendered, not a client state machine.**

**Corrections from [`docs/research/11-engine-comfort-features.md`](docs/research/11-engine-comfort-features.md)
— read it before planning the two evenings.**

- **Half of M6 needs no new wire, and evening 1 ships it.** `InputPassPriority`
  already labels the *Cancel* button `Undo (n)` or `End Turn`; `InputPayMana`
  labels the *OK* button `Auto`; `InputLockUI` labels Cancel while a yield runs.
  `docs/protocol.md` §4 already requires us to render `buttons.*.label` verbatim
  and send `buttonOk` / `buttonCancel`. **So Undo, End Turn, Auto Pay and
  cancel-a-yield are on the wire as of M3** — M6's job is to stop hiding them.
  **There is no `autoPay` act and no `endTurn` act**; inventing one is the
  "board threw the engine's answer away" failure.
- **Phase stops are answered from `WireGuiGame`'s own map**, not from `FPref` and
  not from `YieldController`. `PlayerControllerHuman.isUiSetToSkipPhase` consults
  `YieldController` **only** `if (isRemoteClient())`, and we are not one — that
  map is dead code for us. Forge's desktop holds the state in the GUI object,
  seeds it once per match from `FPref.PHASES_HUMAN` / `PHASES_AI`, and never
  calls `save()`. Do exactly that. The polarity is **stop**, not skip, which is
  what `act: setPhaseStop {stop}` already says.
- **`YieldController` is `forge.gamemodes.match`**, not `forge.gui.control`.
- **A `yieldKey` is a card name.** `StackItemView.getKey()` is
  `CardView.toString() + ": " + …`. Ship an opaque **bridge-minted handle** in
  `stack[].yieldKey` and never render it (`docs/protocol.md` §10.1).
- **Undo undoes mana abilities, not spells**, and the stack is cleared on every
  phase change. Do not build UI that promises more. `GameSnapshot` is a different,
  experimental mechanism and is never wired to `undoLastAction`.
- **"Pass to" is three engine features** (end of turn, the per-(player, phase)
  marker, let-the-stack-resolve) behind one call, `sendYieldUpdate(YieldUpdate)`,
  and all three are cancelled by the same `buttonCancel`. One `act: yieldTo {kind…}`
  covers the set.
- **`endCurrentGame()` empties `getHumanControllers()`** and replaces every
  `PlayerView`. Every cached id, the `ReplyPool`, the phase-stop map and the frame
  log are rebuilt from `openView`, and a **new `hello_ok`** tells the client to
  drop its card map (`docs/protocol.md` §2.1).
- **Space and Escape are not Forge shortcuts.** Space activates the *focused*
  button — `updateButtons(..., focus1)` decides which — so bind it to
  `input.buttons.focus` (`docs/protocol.md` §10.2), not to "OK".
- **There is no "hold priority" in Forge.** Do not render a toggle with no engine
  behind it.

## M7 — Arena mode: the game as a cinematic

**Status: not started. Scheduled after M6.**
**Effort: open-ended; Tier 1 is a few weeks of evenings.**

**Command**

```bash
npm run dev:arena -- fixtures/games/g1.jsonl   # first: a recorded AI-vs-AI game as a cinematic
./scripts/play.sh --arena                       # later: the live game
```

**Deliverable.** A second renderer for the same frame stream, in Three.js via
react-three-fiber inside the existing Vite app: the board as a 3D table, cards as
textured planes, and the transitions in `state.events` played as animations —
cast, enters, attack, block, damage, death, life change — with a choreographed
camera. Tier 1 needs no art assets beyond the Scryfall images we already fetch.
Tier 2 adds duelist avatars and stylised creature manifestations keyed by creature
type and colour. Per-card animation cues draw on the cards' source material (these
are Marvel characters with famous powers), kept as data files, never in the rules.
Design notes, tiers, constraints and the source-material approach:
[`docs/ideas/arena-mode.md`](docs/ideas/arena-mode.md).

**Hard rule.** The arena is a *renderer*. It never decides anything; it plays back
what the engine said. Rules stay in Forge.

---

## Deferred — explicitly out of scope until M6 ships

Not cancelled, not scheduled. Revisit only after M6 lands.

- A second deck, a deck picker, and an AI profile / difficulty selector. (Now
  specified, if it ever comes forward: there is no "difficulty" in Forge, only
  four profile files — `res/ai/{Default,Cautious,Reckless,Experimental}.ai` — and
  a picker sets one string, passed as `profileOverride` to
  `GamePlayerUtil.createAiPlayer`, because the no-override branch **saves**
  `FPref.UI_CURRENT_AI_PROFILE`. `docs/research/11-engine-comfort-features.md` §9.)
- The SQLite (`node:sqlite`) + FTS5 card library, the `oracle_cards` bulk stream,
  a local image cache and an `/api/images` proxy. Report 03 is the spec when we
  want it. (Note for then: the bulk field is **`jsonl_download_uri`**, gzipped
  JSONL; `download_uri` no longer exists.)
- A deck builder.
- `state_patch` / RFC 7386 merge-patch deltas.
- Multiplayer. Accounts. Packaging.
- Engine-level seeded replay (byte-identical re-runs).
- Bug-report zips.

Everything on the README's **NON-GOALS** list is a harder no than this: those are
decisions, not deferrals.

## Only the user can decide

From synthesis §13. The plan below assumes a default for each; a different answer
changes the plan, so raise it rather than quietly re-deciding.

| # | Question | **Default this plan assumes** |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Licence: GPL-3.0-or-later, or AGPL-3.0-or-later so manabrew's `forge-harness` could be forked? | **GPL-3.0-or-later, and no manabrew code.** |
| 2 | Is the +2-evening M1 recorder worth it, or go straight for the browser seat (first game at evening 5, but no replay, no fixtures, JVM-coupled UI work)? | **Keep the M1 recorder.** |
| 3 | React or vanilla TS for `web/`? | **React, with plain hooks.** |
| 4 | Should anything ever rewrite `~/.forge/decks/constructed/Pacho SHIELD.dck` in place to add the missing `\|MSC` suffixes? | **Never rewrite it. Write a copy.** |
| 5 | Card images hot-linked from `cards.scryfall.io`, or proxied through our own origin with a 302 (the way Endstep does)? | **Hot-link in v1.** |
| 6 | Install a JDK? Not needed for this plan, but it would bring `jar`, `jshell`, a debugger and Maven. Unpack Temurin 21 into `tools/jdk/` (no sudo) or `apt install openjdk-21-jdk` (sudo)? | **No JDK. The JRE's `jdk.compiler` / `jdk.jdeps` modules suffice.** |
| 7 | GitHub: public repo or private? Affects whether NOTICE and the Fan Content disclaimer must be publication-quality on day one. | Undecided — **NOTICE is written to publication quality anyway**, so either answer works. |
| 8 | Is losing to the Forge AI acceptable in v1, or does the AI profile / difficulty picker come forward from the deferred list? | **AI difficulty stays deferred.** |
