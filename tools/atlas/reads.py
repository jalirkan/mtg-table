# J193: J177's reads.py, unchanged; the pools are `random-<band>-d508` on J193's night (D508's population).
# J177: J173's reads.py, unchanged. A futile-stopped (partial) decision is never complete, so (i)-(iv) and Q never read one; (vi) counts
# its branches in the branch games per label, the cost they are. J173's header: J171's reads.py, unchanged (J170's, J169's, J168's,
# J167's: J166's reads.py, J162's and J156's definitions, made per spine),
# registered before any J166 data. From atlas.json files named on the command line as NAME:POOL:PATH. Standard library only; no engine.
# A spine is a pair of its own (random decks of one band; the pool is the band, `random-<band>-d488` on J173's and J177's nights); `complete` and
# `decided` are atlas.json's (D480), with J158's definitions as the fallback for an atlas written before it; the agreement reads (i)-(iii)
# and the registered (iv) are made on the spines WITH a Forge map only (D480 point 5); C1's random-map statistic on a spine without one is
# printed as information, with no verdict. Definitions otherwise J156's, unchanged:
#   decided    atlas.json's (D480); fallback every option's mean >= 0.95 under BOTH maps
#   Q          the complete decisions that are not decided (screened decisions are never complete)
#   R          the complete decisions whose rank correlation is defined
#   interval   95% percentile bootstrap, 10,000 draws, seed 150: pool -> spine -> decision when several pools are read; spine ->
#              decision for one pool, which for one spine is decision-level
#   (i)   same best over Q;  (ii) mean rho over R, how many have two options;  (iii) regret at Forge's choice by kind under each
#         map, and how many decisions have a regret interval whose low end is above zero
#   (iv)  C1 "cast now where Forge passes": over Q priority decisions listing pass and at least one cast:/activate: option, the
#         mean over decisions of (the mean random value of the cast/activate options minus pass's random value; an option
#         early stopping dropped counts at its own n); HOLDS on a spine when the point is > 0 and the interval's low end is
#         > 0, else NOT SHOWN, on every spine with a Forge map; the Forge map's same statistic beside (over the options it
#         played), and C2 "don't attack" as information
#   (v)   the guardrail counts of every atlas.json, per spine and per pool
#   (vi)  the sizing line from atlas.json's branch counts and mean branch times, per spine
